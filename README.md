#### Overview
Django + basic UI (with react)


#### Project Structure
- `papers/`: where pdf papers are stored (I have used only two since the URLS mentioned aren't returning pdfs directly using scripts)
- `paper_analyzer/`: backend -> main code is in views `paper_analyzer/analyzer/views.py`
- `paper-analyzer-frontend/`: frontend


- Used open-source LLM, for pdf-parsing used pdfplumber
